 *         <ul>multiple_cache_entry_found: There are multiple cache entries found, the sdk cannot pick the correct access token

 *         <ul>invalid_jwt: JWT returned by the server is not valid, empty or malformed. </ul>
 *         <ul>state_not_match: For authorize request, the sdk will verify the state returned from redirect and the one sent
 *         in the request. This error indicates that it doesn't match. </ul>
